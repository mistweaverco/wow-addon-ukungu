# Ukungu

Ukungu is [swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language) and
means mist/fog/haze.

It is the all in one toolkit for Mistweaver Monks.

## Features

Bring up the options by typing `/ukungu`.
All options are per Character and not per Account.

### Call to Arms tracker

Prints a red message if call to arms is active for Normal and Heroics,
if not already in an instance and not already queued for a dungeon.
Defaults to your current role and filters by that.

Call to Arms tracker can be disabled in the options and
also the filtering by role can be disabled in the options.

Why a CTA tracker? Because you average 5k gold for 15-20 minutes (satchel + runes).

Can be disabled in the options.

 - Low on mana (30% mana)
 - Out of mana (10% mana)
